<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Describe project and my role.</p>
<p>During my internship at OpenText, I worked on their User Experience Design System which supports 100+ prodcuts across 12 product units, reporting directly to the Lead Designer. Using Figma and Web Site Management I created guidelines and designed specifications for various components and elements in the UX Design System to ensure consistency across multiple products.</p>
<p>Other contributions of mine include updating and refininf the component library by creating new interactive components, following the most recent specifications.</p>
