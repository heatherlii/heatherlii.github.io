<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I worked directly with two Lead designers on the project, and my role was to create visual direction for a new feature that would provide Help information that is contextual to the content of the current page.</p>
<p>One of our main goals was to ensure the feature would not be confused with the primary product that it was related to. As such, I was not required to strictly follow existing standards. However, I still needed to provide a design that could sit alongside the existing product design language with a strong level of cohesiveness.</p>
<p>We initially identified a few key screens that contained a variety of information types reanging from standard content paragraphs to tables and callot information. I explored numerous rounds of iteration exploring colour, depth and content containers.</p>
<p>As we narrowed down the styling I also created interactive prototypes that showed the Help panel working and the navigation between various levels.</p>

<h2>Early Iterations</h2>
<p>Start with "random" exploration. I went with cooler colours. Decided to have light grey background for white cards (and tile shadow to "emphasize borders". Search field separate from content. Rounded corners on all corners (looked like chat bubble).</p>

<h2>Table Iterations</h2>
<p>Wanted a more "modern" table (not basic) not something that matches the panel colour and users ("older non-design workers"?) are comfortable with. Hence, explored with different ways to display a "table of info": standard, multi cards, lightweight, callout cards. Explain why decided against black/dark tables.</p>

<h2>Tip Card Iterations</h2>
<p>Explain that we thought of going for a "post it" type of feel. Not to bright (harsh to eyes) but enough to emphasize and draw attention to the info (so reader does not just skim through that section as it can help them).</p>

<h2>Dark Mode Exploration</h2>
<p>Explain how lots of people like and use dark mode often. Adding dark mode panels can help improve their user experience (match their other apps & overall desktop "display theme")</p>
