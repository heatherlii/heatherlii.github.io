<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/about.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>Hello! I am Heather, a first year Systems Design Engineering student at University of Waterloo aspiring to become a designer. From a young age, I have always been interested in creating applicable and visually pleasing designs. Starting from slide shows, to posters/infographics, to merchandise and low-fidelity prototypes, to webpages, I have grown to improve and expand my skills in design. Gradually, I would love to earn the chance to apply my creativity and skills towards a product that other people can use and benefit from!</p>
		
<p>Talk about IDP..... Many of my hobbies and extracurriculars such as dance, choreographing, teaching, and music and film editing involve innovative thinking as well.</p>
