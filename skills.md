					<h3>Figma</h3>
				</header>
				<p>My Figma skills are pretty strong. Talk about Figma Tutorials I created and conducted? This could show the depth of my understanding and my ability to apply it and communicate as well. NO NEED FOR LEARN MORE BUTTON RIGHT? I'm pretty sure I took it out correctly.</p>

					<h3>OnShape (and SolveSpace)</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I picked up on how to use OnShape pretty quickly and know it well enough to build parts quickly. I was able to get used to SolveSpace super quickly since it is somewhat similar to Adobe Illustrator (used in comm tech course in high school). ONSHAPE IS SIMILAR TO SOLID WORKS? I SHOULD BE ABLE TO LEARN HOW TO USE SOLID WORKS QUICKLY (EVEN IF IT ISN'T), AS WELL AS CAD. YAY FOR GOOD SELF LEARNING SKILLS.</p>

					<h3>Garageband & Audacity? (Or Adobe Creative Suite?)</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I'm not sure which one I should add... I mean I could have both still. I should probably put Adobe first since I would most likely use that over garageband (but I just want to show that I use lots of editing softwares and am intersted in lots of creative fields). This explanation is going to be super short.</p>
