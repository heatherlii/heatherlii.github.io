<h3>Social media</h3>
<p>For a Recreational Leadership course, I created a series of Instagram stories to highlight a Black athlete for Black History Month. As a dancer myself, I decided to recognize one of Unionville High School's alumni, Amanda May Wilson, who has done amazing work for the dance community. After gathering research, I contacted Amanda directly to ensure correct information was being shared. The stories below were shared on the athletic council's Instagram page with their (currently) 642 followers.<p>

<h3>Infographics</h3>
<p>The infographics below were created during the early stages of the Black Lives Matter movement for the Dance program I was part of in high school. The main goal was to recognize and emphasize the influence Black culture and Black dancers have on the dance community. All infographics were released and shared with the (currently) 577 followers of the Arts Unionville Dance Instagram page.</p>
