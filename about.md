	<p><b>Thanks for visiting!</b></p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>I am Heather, a second year Systems Design Engineering student at University of Waterloo. Currently, I am exploring the many fields within the design industry, especially UI/UX. Things I love to do include "endlessly" iterating designs and playing around with new ideas/tools. I believe my passion for creating and making things stems from my early exposure to the music and dance communities. When I am not learning or designing, you can probably find me curating a new playlist, practicing calligraphy, or at the studio choreographing/teaching.</p>
	<p>If you are interested in my work, don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
