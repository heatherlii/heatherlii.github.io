<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/me.png %}" alt="" /></span>Hello! I am Heather, a first year Systems Design Engineering student at University of Waterloo aspiring to become a designer.</p>
		
<p>I love designing, iterating, and playing around with new ideas and tools :)</p>

<p>When I am not learning or designing, you will probably find me dancing, choreographing, teaching, or listening to music.</p>
