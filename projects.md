					<h3>Contextual Help</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Here I will write a brief description of the iterative design process including the purpose of the project, consulting meetings where we discussed choices and changes to be made, and the work I did. I made components, and created interactive mockups of the product. SHOULD I CREATE A NEW PAGE FOR EACH PROJECT? WITH A GALLERY OF IMAGES? IF SO I SHOULD EDIT THE LEARN MORE BUTTON HYPERLINK.</p>

					<h3>3-d printed puzzle</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Here I should also briefly explain the purpose of the project and my part in the project. Consulted with teammates and sketched pieces. Designed parts in OnShape, to be printed by school. SHOULD I CHANGE THIS TO LEAD TO A PAGE THAT TALKS ABOUT MY SCHOOL (UW) PROJECTS? THAT WAY I CAN INCLUDE 101L STUFF (NAMETAG, PUZZLE) AND 161 (WHEELCHAIR) STUFF? IT MIGHT BE TOO MUCH, SO I MIGHT JUST CHOOSE 2 MOST RELEVANT PROJECTS THEN.</p>

					<h3>Product Design</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Products I have designed include clothing merchandise for sale, and laser engraved keychains/name tags.</p>
				<p>As a member of the Arts Unionville Dance Porgram in high school, I designed logos and promotional posters. I consulted with other students, who are potential buyers, for their needs and desires in terms of colour schemes, themes, product types, and price ranges. After the designs were finalized and approved, the posters were advertised to the department's 476 instagram followers. We were able to sell 50 clothing items and make over $200 profit.</p>
				<p>The laser engraved pieces were created for Communications (technology and visualization) courses. To create the designs and svg files, I used Adobe Illustrator and SolveSpace. TALK MORE IN DEPTH ABOUT THE PROCESS. MENTION THAT THEY WERE FOR DIFFERENT SCHOOL PROJECTS??? (HIGH SCHOOL & UNI)</p>

					<h3>Other Designs</h3>

				<p>Here I should put all posters/inforgraphics/BHM ig posts. This will separate it from the "graphics" related projects (where I just took care of the graphics/logo to print on a product.</p>
